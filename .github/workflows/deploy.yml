# Application is built using 2 jobs which focuses on different content files.
# build-main is built using every content except en/api and build-api only build with en/api content.
# Both build jobs clones 3 repos - SuperOfficeDocs/docs-next, SuperOfficeDocs/superoffice-docs, SuperOfficeDocs/contribution
# Both build jobs outputs respective artifacts - artifact-main and artifact-api
